Designed and implemented a social network simulation system using C++ and graph-based data structures.
Created features to add/remove users and manage friendships dynamically within the network.
Implemented friend suggestion algorithms based on:
Mutual connections (suggesting friends with the highest shared connections).
Network traversal (recommending friends based on user reachability).
Clustering algorithms (leveraging Jaccard similarity for friend recommendations).
Built a leaderboard system to rank users based on popularity (number of connections) and social influence scores using the PageRank algorithm.
Developed export functionality to represent the network in DOT format for graph visualization with tools like Graphviz.
Optimized graph traversal algorithms for scalability and computational efficiency.
Applied data structures like unordered maps and sets for efficient user and connection management.
Enhanced the algorithm to handle edge cases, such as isolated nodes and disconnected graphs, ensuring accuracy and stability.
